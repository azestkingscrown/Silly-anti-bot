## Authorization Hierarchy

### Role Levels

**Owner**
- All administrative functions
- System management (updates, restart)
- Configuration management
- User management
- Training data management

**Dev (Developers)**
- All administrative functions (now same as owner)
- System management (updates, restart) - NEW
- Configuration management - NEW
- User management - NEW
- Training data management
- Can create/update other developers

**User (Regular Users)**
- Login to portal
- View training images
- View configuration (read-only)
- No modification permissions

---

## Code Changes

### Backend (web_server.py)

**Update Decorator Usage:**
```python
# Before
@app.route('/api/restart', methods=['POST'])
@dev_or_owner_required
def restart_services():
    if session.get('role') != 'owner':
        return jsonify({'error': 'Only the owner can restart'}), 403
    # ... restart logic

# After
@app.route('/api/restart', methods=['POST'])
@dev_or_owner_required
def restart_services():
    logger.warning(f"Restart by {session.get('username')} (role: {session.get('role')})")
    # ... restart logic (no role check)
```

**All User Management Endpoints:**
```python
# Before
@app.route('/api/users', methods=['POST'])
@admin_required
def api_create_user():
    # owner-only logic

# After
@app.route('/api/users', methods=['POST'])
@dev_or_owner_required
def api_create_user():
    # dev and owner access
```

### Documentation

**Updated Files:**
- `ADMIN_PORTAL_GUIDE.md` - Access requirements clarified
- Web portal descriptions remain unchanged (already generic)

## Security Implications

### Positive
- Clear role hierarchy
- Better delegation of responsibility
- Team members can manage their own instances
- No single point of failure for admin tasks
- Proper logging of all admin actions

### Maintained Security
- Session-based authentication still required
- API token validation required
- All operations logged with username and timestamp
- Role validation on every request
- Owner account still special (cannot be deleted)

### Best Practices
- Devs should use dedicated dev accounts (not shared)
- Restrict dev account creation to trusted team members
- Monitor admin portal logs for unusual activity
- Regularly review user permissions
- Keep dev passwords secure

---

## Practical Implications

### For Single Admin (Owner Only)
- No change to workflow
- Owner still has full control
- Can delegate to dev role when needed

### For Teams with Developers
- Developers can now manage their own instances independently
- No need to contact owner for routine updates
- Faster incident response (devs can restart immediately)
- Better load distribution of admin tasks
- Team members empowered to troubleshoot

### For Delegated Management
- Each team can have lead dev as admin
- Lead dev manages other team members
- Reduces bottleneck on owner account
- Better scalability

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Dev account can check for updates
- [ ] Dev account can pull updates
- [ ] Dev account can restart services
- [ ] Dev account can manage users
- [ ] Dev account can update configuration
- [ ] Owner account still works same as before

## Migration Notes

### Existing Instances
- No database changes needed
- No configuration changes required
- Simply rebuild with updated code
- Existing dev accounts instantly gain new permissions

### New Installations
- Dev role automatically has full permissions
- Works as expected out of the box
